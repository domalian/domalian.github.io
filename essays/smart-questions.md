"There are no stupid questions."

Many of us have heard of this saying before by professors as a way to encourage class participation. However, only few do take it to heart as experience have proven to us that there are, indeed, stupid questions, be it hinted by the raise of an eyebrow, or a snicker from a classmate. In the end, the equivalency of this saying should be, "Don't be afraid of asking questions."

## Gauge the situation

In a lecture setting, there aren't many ways of avoiding stupid questions. It's fast-paced, and time won't stop for you to form the _perfect_ question. Just make sure to think of the importance of the subject and if it needs to be addressed during class time, then ask away!

Now, asking questions outside of a classroom setting, on the other hand, is a different beast. There are many pitfalls to avoid, especially when they're asked online.

## Good answers follow good questions

As clearly explained by Raymond in [_How to Ask Questions the Smart Way_](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#asking), questions are free in the worldwide web, and so are answers. Unless it's a paid website with monthly subscriptions for asking help, answers are provided by volunteers out of their kindness. As volunteers are humans with lives of their own, they'll only answer questions that they find interesting, easy to answer, or would benefit many. When the question could be easily answered by a simple search in the web or by reading a manual, the answers would usually vary from being helpful, unhelpful, or downright sarcastic that are along the lines of _RTFM_ and _STFW_.

When questions are asked the right way, people tend to be more cooperative and willing to help. Answers will more precise and helpful with less time wasted by both parties.

## Asking questions the smart way

To ask questions that would result in positive and helpful replies, one should do the following when they are applicable:

1. Read the manual or search the web if your problem has already been addressed and solved
   - This shows that you have attempted to find the solution, and that it can't be find by these simple methods.
2. Use the right forum for your questions
   - You _will_ get unhelpful and sarcastic comments if you ask in the wrong place.
3. Use meaningful, specific subject headers
   - Broad headers often get ignored instinctively and make it harder to quickly grasp the issue, making it difficult for others with the same problem to find your post.
4. Be precise and detailed while being grammatical, but keep in mind that volume is not precision
   - This makes it more tempting for people to reply as it's easier and faster to provide you with helpful answers that requires less follow-ups.
5. Describe the goal, and then the particular step that blocks your path
   - This helps others know if you were taking the right steps to your goal to being with.
6. Describe the symptoms of the problem, not your guesses
   - Unless it is important information, it usually isn't helpful and only increases volume.
7. Don't ask homework questions, but the concepts
   - People that know how to help you will usually find it distasteful when they find posts that are only asking others to solve their homework.
8. Don't grovel
   - This isn't useful information, and distracts others away from the actual problem
9. Be courteous
   - Showing your appreciation increases the chance of getting a useful answers.

## Conclusion

Asking questions is easy, but getting the right answer is harder because it depends on someone elseâ€™s time and effort. That's why it's very important to ask questions wisely, making it easier for volunteers to provide helpful answers that can also benefit others facing the same issue. Whether you're learning a new hobby, debugging code, or fixing a wall, the art of asking questions is a crucial skill in our modern world.

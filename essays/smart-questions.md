"There are no stupid questions."

Many of us have heard of this saying before by professors as a way to encourage class participation. However, only few do take it to heart as experience have proven to us that there are, indeed, stupid questions, be it hinted by the raise of an eyebrow, or a snicker from a classmate. In the end, the equivalency of this saying should be, "Don't be afraid of asking questions."

In a lecture setting, there aren't many ways of avoiding stupid questions. It's fast-paced, and time won't stop for you to just think of forming the _perfect_ question. Make sure to think of the importance of the subject and if it needs to be addressed during class time, then ask away!

Now, asking questions, outside of a classroom setting, on the other hand, is a different beast. There are many pitfalls to avoid, especially when they're asked online.
